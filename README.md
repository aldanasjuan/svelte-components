## Random svelte component collection

This is not intended for anyone to use except me but I make it public in case it's helpful to someone.

I like to reduce the NPM installs I do so I generally just copy/paste the code for the components I need into a project's src/lib/components folder. If you want to use them just copy/paste the code into fresh file and modify to your liking.

Sorry for any spaghetti, bad accessibility, etc...
